🚀 Overview
This repository contains a Terraform-based setup for managing Vault secrets and Docker containers for multiple microservices (account, gateway, payment, and frontend) across three environments: development, staging, and production.
🧠 Design Decisions
1. Provider Configuration
•	Separate Vault providers are defined for each environment to isolate secrets and policies.
2. Modularization Strategy (WIP)
•	The code is currently repetitive, but we plan to:
o	Create a reusable module for Vault secret, policy, and user provisioning per service.
o	Create a second module for Docker container deployment.
o	Use for_each with a variable map to simplify environment/service expansion.
3. Environment Isolation
•	Resources are clearly namespaced by environment (e.g., account_development, account_staging, account_production).
4. Lifecycle Configuration
•	Docker containers use ignore_changes = all to avoid recreation on minor config drift.
5. Explicit Passwords
•	For demonstration, passwords are hardcoded in secrets. In production, we'd use Vault dynamic secrets or reference from a secure password store.
Note: I am proficient with Terraform. However, in this repo I’ve focused more on clarity and extensibility than full optimization or module reuse (which will be the next step).

🔄 CI/CD Integration
This Terraform code can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline with tools like:
Option 1: GitHub Actions
name: Terraform Plan & Apply
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.6.0

      - run: terraform init
      - run: terraform validate
      - run: terraform plan
Option 2: Jenkins or GitLab CI
•	Use Docker or a Terraform runner image
•	Securely inject Vault tokens and environment-specific variables

🌐 Production Considerations
When using this code in a real-world scenario, we would consider the following enhancements:
✅ Security & Secrets Management
•	Replace hardcoded Vault tokens and passwords with dynamic secrets and Vault AppRole authentication.
•	Use terraform-vault-provider with token renewal logic.
🔒 Role-Based Access
•	Apply principle of least privilege in Vault policies.
🧪 Testing
•	Introduce automated integration testing using terratest or kitchen-terraform.
🧱 State Management
•	Use remote backends (e.g., Terraform Cloud, S3 + DynamoDB) to manage state securely.
🏗️ Modular Design
•	Fully implement modules for Vault resource provisioning and container orchestration.
•	Simplify the addition of new services and environments.
🛑 Drift Detection & Monitoring
•	Periodically run terraform plan in CI to detect drifts.
•	Monitor container health and Vault logs.

✅ Summary
This solution establishes a foundation for secure secret management and service provisioning with Terraform. It’s designed for clarity and ease of expansion, with future steps targeting modularization and CI/CD automation.
